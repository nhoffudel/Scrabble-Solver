To run, type make and then ./output

To see an example with an empty board, go into main and pass "board1.txt" into readBoard

To see an example with a nonempty board, go into main and pass "board.txt" into readBoard

The location that outputs is in the format (how far across, how far down) starting from the top left.
The numbers go from 1-15 so that the top left is (1, 1) and the bottom left is (15, 15)
The location that outputs is where the word that outputs begins on the board, and either a direction of 
right or down is provided.

We did do wildcard code but it wasn't full working so we commented it out
